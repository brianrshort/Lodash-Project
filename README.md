# Lodash Project

This project uses a built object to mimic many of the functions of the Lodash JavaScript utility library. 

# Motivation

This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Back-End Developer certification program. The goal was to practice JavaScript object properties, methods, and test-driven development. 

# Installation and Tests

To install, use, and test the _.js object, use the following steps:

* Download the folders and files onto your computer. 
* From the command line, run "node test/METHODNAME.js" 
* NOTE! You put the name of the specific method you are trying to test where "METHODNAME" is in the example CLI language listed here. For example, "node test/clamp.js"
